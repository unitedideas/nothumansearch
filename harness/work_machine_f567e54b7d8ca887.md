# QLimit score-fix private cleanup closeout

WorkItem: `work_machine_f567e54b7d8ca887`
Date: `2026-06-08T03:11:21Z`

Required pre-read completed before any private score-fix mutation:

- `tools/geo-jobs-redacted-read.sh`
- `ops/ledgers/score-fix-pending-followup-2026-05-12.md`
- `ops/ledgers/score-fix-internal-test-cleanup-2026-05-12.md`

Fresh helper execution:

```sh
./tools/geo-jobs-redacted-read.sh
```

Result:

- The helper failed closed before fetching admin rows: `missing Keychain service: nhs-admin-api-key nothumansearch-admin-key`.
- No raw admin rows were fetched.
- No private score-fix mutation was attempted.
- No customer-visible score-fix email was sent.
- No public-action lock was created or reused.
- No external customer row was mutated.

Aggregate-only proof available to this executor from the WorkItem:

- Total score-fix rows: 11.
- `real_candidate pending`: 2 `dot_com`.
- `test_like pending`: 4 `dot_com`.
- `test_like lead`: 1 `dot_com`.
- `test_like paid`: 2 `dot_com`.
- `test_like internal_test`: 2 `foundry_owned`.
- Customer-visible score-fix follow-up due now: 0.

Decision:

- Keep the score-fix cleanup lane open as `credential_required`.
- External `real_candidate` pending rows stay untouched; the already-contacted external pending cohort must not receive another customer-visible score-fix email unless a future duplicate check plus fresh public-action lock prove it is due.
- Test-like pending rows require a credential-capable executor and a repo-supported private admin workflow that can classify test-like rows without committing raw row data.

Verification:

- `python3 -m json.tool harness/generated-work-items.json >/dev/null`
- `GOCACHE=/private/tmp/nothumansearch-go-cache go test ./...`

Commit status:
