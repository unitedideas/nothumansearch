# QLimit Score-Fix Cleanup Closeout

WorkItem: `work_machine_fdae78f9589818da`
Date: 2026-06-08T17:10:35Z
Automation: `business-agent-not-human-search`

Required pre-read completed before any private score-fix mutation:

- `tools/geo-jobs-redacted-read.sh`
- `ops/ledgers/score-fix-pending-followup-2026-05-12.md`
- `ops/ledgers/score-fix-internal-test-cleanup-2026-05-12.md`

Fresh helper execution:

```sh
./tools/geo-jobs-redacted-read.sh
```

Result:

- The helper failed closed before fetching admin rows: `missing Keychain service: nhs-admin-api-key nothumansearch-admin-key`.
- No raw admin rows were fetched.
- No private score-fix mutation was attempted.
- No customer-visible score-fix email was sent.
- No public-action lock was created or reused.
- No external customer row was mutated.

Latest aggregate proof remains the WorkItem-provided aggregate from 2026-06-08T17:09:31Z:

- Total score-fix rows: 11.
- `real_candidate pending`: 2 `dot_com`.
- `test_like pending`: 4 `dot_com`.
- `test_like lead`: 1 `dot_com`.
- `test_like paid`: 2 `dot_com`.
- `test_like internal_test`: 2 `foundry_owned`.
- Customer-visible score-fix follow-up due now: 0.

Decision:

- External `real_candidate pending` rows stay untouched; prior follow-up proof in `ops/ledgers/score-fix-pending-followup-2026-05-12.md` still blocks another customer-visible score-fix email unless a future duplicate check plus fresh public-action lock prove it is due.
- The current private admin action model only supports `mark_internal_test` on Foundry-owned pending rows. The remaining `test_like pending` cleanup is credential-gated and needs a repo-supported private admin workflow for non-Foundry test-like rows before mutation.
- Keep the score-fix cleanup lane open as `credential_required`.
